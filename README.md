##👋 Hi, I’m Manu — Bioinformatics • Data • Dev • Cybersecurity

Welcome to my GitHub! I work at the intersection of biotechnology, data systems, and software engineering, building tools that bridge scientific workflows with robust, production-ready code.

I enjoy creating automation pipelines, data workflows, interactive applications, and secure systems, combining my background in Bioinformatics, Biology, and IT engineering.

## 🚀 What I Do
### 🧬 Bioinformatics & Data Science

Pipeline development (Python, R, Bash)

Data analysis & visualization

Genomics/Bioinfo tooling

Scientific computing & reproducibility

### 💻 Software Development

Full-stack & backend scripting

Python applications (Tkinter, asyncio, FastAPI, CLI tools)

VBA + Access + Excel automation for enterprise workflows

API integration & ETL tooling

### 🔐 Cybersecurity & Infrastructure

Secure dev practices

Network configuration & analysis

Scripting for automation, auditing, and hardening

## 🧩 Highlighted Projects

* Audio Meta-Extractor
A Python/Tkinter GUI that extracts and exports metadata from audio files.

* Excel and Access Automation Modules
Enterprise-grade import mappers, dynamic range parsers, and data pipelines.

* DevOps / Network Exercises
Scripts, ACL configs, and network designs for cybersecurity training.

(More projects coming — some currently private!)
